    - Author
    - CSS stylesheets

    - An extra section
    - Cover page

  - EPUB 3.0 sample with minimal features as well as an EPUB 2.0 table of contents for maximum backwards-compatibility

These samples are for testing/development and are intentionally minimal. For samples with more features, see https://github.com/IDPF/epub3-samples
