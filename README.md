  - Based off minimal-v32 with a few additional basic features:
    - Author
    - CSS stylesheets
    - An extra section
    - Cover page
- minimal-v2
  - EPUB 2.0 sample with minimal features
- minimal-v3
  - EPUB 3.0 sample with minimal features
- minimal-v32
  - EPUB 3.0 sample with minimal features as well as an EPUB 2.0 table of contents for maximum backwards-compatibility

To build the EPUB files, run the `pack-epubs.sh` script.

All samples have been validated with the [EPUB Validator](http://validator.idpf.org/).

These samples are for testing/development and are intentionally minimal. For samples with more features, see https://github.com/IDPF/epub3-samples
